<p>Hello there, and welcome to my academic portfolio!<br><br>My name is Rabindra Lamsal, and I was an M.Tech Research Scholar (2017-19) at the School of Computer and Systems Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. I was also associated with the Special Centre for Disaster Research, Jawaharlal Nehru University, as a Project associate from 2018-19.<br><br>

I maintain a list of my publications and research projects in the <a href="/research/">Research</a> page, and a list of other non-research projects in the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> page.<br><br>

Feel free to read my M.Tech dissertation's <a href="/rabindra_lamsal_mtech_abstract.pdf">abstract</a>. To get a better insight on my life so far, you can have a look at my <a href="/rabindra_lamsal_cv.pdf">curriculum vitae</a>. </p>
